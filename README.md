A utility that will parse through the E:V API and present information to the user in a readable format.

#### You must install sslsplit

#### iptables must be running.

For Pilot updating, it's pretty simple:

### ./run_split.sh 
1) Open a terminal window.

This will set up the iptable reroute and masking. You will need to run in the directory that has the cert keys (included).

2) edit run_split.sh and change $HOST to your gateway's Internal IP.

3) run ./run_split.sh /to/some/dir/

4) Open another terminal window.

### ./newParse.py

This will log and continually parse through live pilot output received from the EV services.

This should now also call for a pilot update.

5) Create /to/some/dir/output/ directory.

6) from the git repo directory, run ./newParse.py -d /to/some/dir/eveLogger/ -o /to/some/dir/output/

7) Launch EVE: Valkyrie

8) Play your brains out. You should see run_split.sh terminal logging ssl connections.

9) Upon completion, ctrl-c in both terminals to end split and parsing.

10) Collect fullpilot.json from ~/output directory.

11) Mail to defied@deadplanet.net
